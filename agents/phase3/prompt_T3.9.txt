You are implementing Phase 3, Task T3.9 of the ATOMiK project.

FIRST: Read these context files:
- specs/rtl_architecture.md (design specification)
- rtl/atomik_core_v2.v (integrated core)
- rtl/atomik_delta_acc.v (accumulator)
- rtl/atomik_state_rec.v (reconstructor)
- sim/SIMULATION_RESULTS.md (verification results)
- reports/resource_utilization.md (T3.8 output)
- reports/timing_analysis.md (T3.6 output)
- synth/README.md (synthesis documentation)
- .github/atomik-status.yml (current project status)

CONTEXT:
- All Phase 3 implementation and verification complete
- Create final validation report for Phase 3
- This report will be reviewed by human operator before proceeding to Phase 4

TASK T3.9: Create Hardware Validation Report

Create reports/PHASE_3_COMPLETION_REPORT.md with:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Phase 3 objectives achieved
   - Key metrics vs targets
   - Overall status: PASS/FAIL

2. **Implementation Summary**
   | Module | File | Lines | Function |
   |--------|------|-------|----------|
   | Delta Accumulator | rtl/atomik_delta_acc.v | ? | XOR accumulation |
   | State Reconstructor | rtl/atomik_state_rec.v | ? | State output |
   | Core v2 | rtl/atomik_core_v2.v | ? | Integration |
   | PLL | rtl/pll/atomik_pll_81m.v | ? | Clock generation |
   
   Count actual lines in each file and fill in the table.

3. **Verification Results**
   - Simulation test results (reference sim/SIMULATION_RESULTS.md)
   - Coverage metrics (if available)
   - Comparison to Python reference model
   - Test case summary with pass/fail counts

4. **Synthesis Results**
   - Timing closure: Pass/Fail (reference reports/timing_analysis.md)
   - Resource utilization summary (reference reports/resource_utilization.md)
   - Power estimates (if available)
   - Maximum frequency achieved vs target (50 MHz)

5. **Performance Validation**
   - Accumulate latency: 1 cycle (target: 1) ✓/?
   - Reconstruct latency: 1 cycle (target: 1) ✓/?
   - Maximum frequency achieved: ? MHz
   - Assessment against Phase 2 predictions

6. **Key Achievement: Read Penalty Eliminated**
   - Phase 2 software benchmark: 32% slower for read-heavy workloads
   - Phase 3 hardware design: O(1) reconstruction (single XOR)
   - Theoretical improvement: 32% → 0% read penalty
   - This validates the core hardware optimization thesis of ATOMiK

7. **Validation Gates Summary**
   | Gate | Threshold | Actual | Status |
   |------|-----------|--------|--------|
   | RTL simulation | 100% pass | ?/? tests | ✓/✗ |
   | Verilator lint | 0 errors | ? errors | ✓/✗ |
   | Timing closure | Slack ≥ 0ns | ?ns | ✓/✗ |
   | LUT utilization | ≤ 80% | ?% | ✓/✗ |
   | FF utilization | ≤ 80% | ?% | ✓/✗ |

8. **Lessons Learned**
   - What worked well
   - Challenges encountered  
   - Design decisions and rationale
   - Recommendations for future iterations

9. **Artifacts Delivered**
   List all files created in Phase 3:
   - RTL modules
   - Testbenches
   - Constraints
   - Scripts
   - Reports
   - Documentation

10. **Next Steps**
    - Phase 4: SDK Development
    - Future hardware optimizations to consider:
      - Parallel delta input capability
      - Wider bus support (128/256-bit)
      - Hardware debugging features
