## Key Results to Present

### Software Benchmarks (Phase 2)
- **Memory Traffic**: 95-100% reduction (MB → KB)
- **Execution Time**: +22% to +55% improvement on write-heavy workloads
- **Parallel Efficiency**: 85% vs 0% (baseline cannot parallelize)
- **Statistical Validation**: 75% of comparisons significant (p < 0.05)

### Hardware Validation (Phase 3)
- **Operation Latency**: Single-cycle (10.6 ns @ 94.5 MHz) for ALL operations
- **Hardware Tests**: 10/10 passing
- **Resource Utilization**: 7% logic, 9% registers
- **Key Finding**: Software "read penalty" eliminated in hardware

## Key Messages

1. **Memory traffic reduction is the primary win** — orders of magnitude (MB → KB)

2. **Software "read penalty" is NOT fundamental** — it's a Python artifact eliminated in hardware

3. **Hardware achieves uniform single-cycle latency** — no read/write trade-off

4. **Parallelism is architectural** — commutativity enables lock-free operation; baseline cannot parallelize at all

5. **Theory to silicon validated** — Lean4 proofs confirmed in FPGA hardware
