Title: Delta-State Algebra: A Formally Verified Foundation for Transient State Computation

Authors: Matthew H. Rockwell

Abstract: We present delta-state algebra, a mathematical foundation for transient state computation that replaces persistent architectural state with composable state differences. Unlike traditional computational models where state is read, modified, and written back, delta-state computation expresses transformations as atomic deltas that compose via XOR operations, forming an Abelian group. This algebraic structure enables hardware optimizations impossible in conventional architectures: deltas can be accumulated in any order, composed before application, and reduced via parallel XOR trees with O(log n) latency.

We formally verify 92 theorems in the Lean4 proof assistant, establishing: (1) the delta-state algebra forms a well-defined Abelian group under composition; (2) state transitions are deterministic and reversible; (3) sequential operations can be collapsed into single delta applications; and (4) the model is Turing complete via counter machine simulation. All proofs are machine-checked with zero unverified obligations (sorry statements).

These results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for ATOMiK, a hardware-native architecture that achieves bounded, deterministic latency by eliminating cache hierarchies, speculative execution, and coherency protocols. The formal verification establishes that the architectural optimizations preserve computational semantics while enabling order-of-magnitude improvements in memory efficiency and latency determinism. To our knowledge, this represents the first formally verified foundation for transient state computation.
