*Generated: 2026-02-03*

## Target Verticals

| Vertical | Use Case | Priority |
|----------|----------|----------|
| High-Frequency Trading | Tick processing, state sync | High |
| IoT / Edge Computing | Sensor fusion, low-power sync | High |
| FPGA Designers | IP core licensing | High |
| Video Processing | Frame delta compression | Medium |
| Database Replication | Change propagation | Medium |
| Digital Twins | Physical-virtual sync | Medium |
| Gaming | State synchronisation | Low |

## Outreach Status

| Target | Type | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| HFT firms (top 10) | Direct | Not contacted |
| IoT integrators | Direct | Not contacted |
| FPGA design houses | Direct | Not contacted |
| Semiconductor IP buyers | Via accelerator | Not contacted |

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Not contacted** — on target list
2. **Contacted** — initial outreach sent
3. **Engaged** — active discussions
4. **LOI** — letter of intent signed
5. **Pilot** — evaluation deployment

## Next Steps

- Complete incorporation (C-Corp) for credibility
- Apply to semiconductor accelerators (Silicon Catalyst, HAX)
- Begin direct outreach to HFT and FPGA design firms
- Develop pilot programme terms
