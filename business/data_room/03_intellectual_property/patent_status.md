## Claims Summary

1. **Delta-state accumulation architecture** — XOR-based single-cycle
   state accumulation with O(1) reconstruction
2. **Parallel accumulator bank with merge tree** — N independent XOR
   accumulators with combinational binary merge for linear scaling
3. **Execution model** — LOAD/ACCUMULATE/READ instruction set with
   formal algebraic guarantees

## Supporting Evidence

- 92 formal proofs in Lean4 (mathematical correctness)
- Hardware validation on FPGA (silicon correctness)
- 25-configuration synthesis sweep (scalability)
- 80/80 hardware tests (reliability)
