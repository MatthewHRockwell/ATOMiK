## Capital Efficiency Narrative

ATOMiK demonstrates exceptional capital efficiency: a complete computing
architecture — from mathematical proof to silicon validation — built for
less than the cost of a single engineering hour at market rates.

This was enabled by:
1. AI-augmented development (Claude for code generation and verification)
2. Open-source toolchains (Lean4, Gowin EDA, Python ecosystem)
3. Low-cost FPGA hardware ($10/board)
4. Solo founder with full-stack capability (math → hardware → software)
