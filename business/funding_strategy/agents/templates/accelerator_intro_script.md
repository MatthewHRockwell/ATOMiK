# Accelerator Intro Script (30 seconds)

Hi, I'm Matthew Rockwell. I built a computing architecture that
does one billion operations per second on a ten-dollar FPGA —
for two hundred and twenty-five dollars total.

ATOMiK uses XOR delta-state accumulation, formally verified with
92 Lean4 proofs and validated on hardware. We're targeting
semiconductor IP licensing in the six hundred billion dollar market.

I'd love to tell you more.
