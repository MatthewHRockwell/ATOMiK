  short: "Hardware-accelerated delta-state computing in silicon"
  long: >-
    ATOMiK is a formally verified hardware architecture for delta-state
    computing. Rather than the traditional Load-Modify-Store cycle, ATOMiK
    accumulates state changes via single-cycle XOR operations, achieving 1
    billion operations per second on a $10 FPGA. The architecture is backed
    by 92 Lean4 formal proofs and a 5-language SDK.

how_far_along:
  answer: >-
    Working FPGA prototype achieving 1,056 Mops/s (16 parallel banks) on a
    Tang Nano 9K. 92 formal proofs in Lean4 with zero sorry statements.
    314 passing tests across 5 SDK languages (Python, Rust, C, JavaScript,
    Verilog). 80/80 hardware tests passing. All 6 development phases
    complete. Patent pending. $225 total development cost.

why_now:
  answer: >-
    CHIPS Act investment in domestic semiconductor R&D, growing demand for
    energy-efficient compute at the edge ($61B -> $232B by 2030), AI
    inference crisis (90% of lifetime cycles are inference, $300B+
    hyperscaler capex), and post-Moore economics making novel architectures
    competitive against brute-force scaling below 3nm.

what_is_the_technical_approach:
  answer: >-
    XOR-based delta accumulation: State = S0 XOR d1 XOR d2 ... XOR dn.
    This yields commutativity (lock-free parallelism), self-inverse (instant
    undo), and single-cycle latency (no carry propagation). N parallel
    accumulator banks with binary merge tree achieve linear throughput
    scaling. Implemented in Verilog, synthesised on Tang Nano 9K FPGA.

what_is_the_market:
  answer: >-
    TAM: ~$85B (FPGA $10-14B + edge computing $61B + AI accelerators
    $10.2B). SAM: ~$8B. SOM (Year 5): ~$80M. Beachhead markets:
    high-frequency trading (single-cycle tick processing), IoT sensor
    fusion (lock-free multi-stream merge), streaming transforms (95%
    memory reduction for frame delta pipelines).

what_is_the_business_model:
  answer: >-
    ARM-style IP licensing at 90%+ gross margin. Four revenue streams:
    (1) RTL IP licensing to chip designers, (2) vertical hardware modules
    for specific markets, (3) SDK platform subscription, (4) professional
    services for custom integration.

how_is_this_different:
  answer: >-
    ATOMiK is the only hardware architecture with machine-verified
    algebraic properties. 92 Lean4 proofs create an irreproducible moat —
    competitors would need years of mathematical work to replicate. Working
    silicon on $10 FPGA (not simulation), patent pending, and a full-stack
    implementation from math proofs to 5-language SDK.

what_do_you_need:
  answer: >-
    Seed capital to fund ASIC feasibility study, larger FPGA port (64+
    banks), vertical SDK modules for beachhead markets, and first pilot
    customer deployments. Delaware C-Corp incorporation is the immediate
    next step.

team_background:
  answer: >-
    Solo technical founder who built the entire ATOMiK stack — from 92
    Lean4 formal proofs to FPGA synthesis to a 5-language SDK — for $225
    total development cost. Demonstrates exceptional technical range and
    capital efficiency.

what_are_the_risks:
  answer: >-
    Key risks: (1) ASIC tape-out cost and timeline, mitigated by starting
    with FPGA IP licensing; (2) market adoption timing, mitigated by
    multiple beachhead verticals; (3) solo founder, mitigated by
    AI-augmented development and hiring plan; (4) SBIR reauthorisation
    lapse, mitigated by pursuing multiple funding paths simultaneously.
