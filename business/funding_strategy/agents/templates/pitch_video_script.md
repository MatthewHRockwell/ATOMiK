## Hook (10s)

One billion operations per second. Ten dollar chip. Two hundred and
twenty-five dollars total development cost. I'm Matthew Rockwell,
and this is ATOMiK.

## What We Built (30s)

ATOMiK is a delta-state computing architecture. Instead of moving
entire state vectors, we accumulate only what changed using XOR.
This eliminates carry propagation, enables lock-free parallelism,
and provides instant undo — all in a single clock cycle.

We proved it works with 92 formal theorems in Lean4, then validated
it on real FPGA hardware with eighty out of eighty tests passing.

## Why It Matters (20s)

The semiconductor IP market is over six hundred billion dollars.
High-frequency traders, IoT companies, and FPGA designers all
need faster state synchronisation. ATOMiK gives them orders of
magnitude improvement at near-zero integration cost.

## Traction (15s)

Six development phases complete. Five-language SDK with 353 tests.
Two research papers in draft. Working three-node hardware demo.
All built by one founder for two hundred and twenty-five dollars.

## Ask (15s)

We're raising to scale IP licensing and accelerate ASIC development.
If you're investing in semiconductor innovation, let's talk.
