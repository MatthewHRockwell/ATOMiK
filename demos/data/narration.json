        "First, we load a 64-bit initial state and read it back. The hardware preserves every bit perfectly.",
        "Next, we accumulate a single delta. XOR with zero gives us the delta itself — the identity property.",
        "Now multiple deltas: d1 XOR d2 XOR d3. Associativity means we can group them any way we like.",
